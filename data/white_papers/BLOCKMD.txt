ABOUT BLOCK M.D.
BLOCK M.D. is a healthcare interoperability platform build over the convenience and security of Distributed Ledger Technology. The use of blockchain technology creates unique opportunity to reduce complexity, enable trustless collaboration, and create secure and immutable information.
Imagine that every electronic health record (EHR) sent updates about medications, problems, and allergy lists to an open-source, community-wide trusted ledger, so additions and subtractions to the medical record were well understood and auditable across organizations. Instead of just displaying data from a single database, the EHR could display data from every database referenced in the ledger. The end result would be perfectly reconciled community-wide information about you, with guaranteed integrity from the point of data generation to the point of use, without manual human intervention.
